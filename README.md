Just a place to experiment with Tableau's Embedding API

## Deployed Version

https://tableau-embedded-tinkering.vercel.app/

## Stack

- NextJS
- Tableau Embedding API
- Panda CSS

## Random Notes and Thoughts

- Tableau Embedding and SSR can be tricky to get to play nicely
- NextJS code here is _very_ poorly optimized. That was an intentional choice as this is just some early tinkering and not meant to be production-ready by any stretch.
- Built out type definitions for some of the Embedding API surface. That code is at `/src/types`.
